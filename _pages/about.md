Hi there! My name Calvin and I am a final year PhD student at the the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy (with frequent visits to Peyton Hall, Princeton University ). I work with large galaxy surveys as a stress-test of the standard cosmological model, hoping to help answer some of the biggest questions in cosmology: What is dark matter? What is dark energy? How does these evolve over time?

About me
======
I graduated from the University of Cambridge, Robinson College in the summer of 2022, with a first class degree (with distinction) in Natural Sciences, specialising in astrophysics and ranking second in my cohort. During my time at Robinson, I was happy to receive a number of awards, including the Warden's Prize for top college academic performance and the Mather's Research Grant to support top college undergraduate research. My master's thesis, titled "Constraints on late time decaying dark matter" was supervised by George Efstathiou. I began my PhD in the summer of 2022, supervised by Alexandra Amon and George Efstathiou at Camrbdige's Institute of Astronomy. Alex started a faculty position at Princeton shortly after, and I visit her often.

My research
======
I work with weak lensing galaxy surveys. Subtle distortion of the shape of galaxies due to intervening matter acting like a lense is a measureable effect, and can tell us about the content of the "stuff" doing the lensing. Surveys like the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES) alongside future surveys like Euclid, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and Vera Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time. With data from these telescopes, we can constrain cosmological parameters and models.
